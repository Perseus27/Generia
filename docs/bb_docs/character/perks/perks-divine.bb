[h2]What are Divine Perks?[/h2]
Divine perks are active or passive abilities related to the domains of a specific deity, but not bound to a spellcasting proficiency like [i]Acolyte[/i] or [i]Nox[/i] spells.
[h2]How do I get Divine Perks?[/h2]
You can simply buy them with SP like any other perk, provided your character is in some way aligned with the deity. Sometimes, a deity may offer a discount for a perk, for example after a successful challenge in the Tower.
[h2]Alignments and Allegiances[/h2]
While the gods of the [b]Pantheon of Light[/b] and their followers dominate the continent, there are many deities who are either neutral or outright hostile towards them. Demonstrating a perk of a neutral god in front of a Templar of Sol may earn a raised eyebrow; showing off hostile powers might very well result in violence.
