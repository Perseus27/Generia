[h1]Shamans[/h1]
Shamans have a powerful bond with the spirit world and use it to strengthen their allies and summon powerful elementals.

[h1]Special Features[/h1]
[h2]Local Elementals[/h2]
Shamans are highly dependent on their surroundings. Their spells are influenced by which elemental spirits are present nearby; presence varies by place and affects both [section:clr-mp]MP[/section] cost and damage type. If there is no presence at all, the spell cannot be cast. Certain consumables (e.g., elemental cores) can substitute for natural sources.
[h3]Presence & MP costs[/h3]
Costs are written [i]weak[/i]/[i]normal[/i]/[i]strong[/i]. Example: [section:clr-mp]3/2/1 MP[/section] means costs drop from [section:clr-value]3[/section] (weak presence) to [section:clr-value]1[/section] (strong presence).
[h3]Environmental Preferences[/h3]
Elemental spirits are drawn to concentrations of their element. [b]Examples:[/b]
