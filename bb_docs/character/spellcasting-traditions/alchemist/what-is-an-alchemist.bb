[h1]Alchemists[/h1]
Alchemists create tools and substances from magical materials. Their craft serves on the battlefield and at the healer’s bench alike – turning rare reagents into munitions, tonics, salves, bombs, and even temporary constructs.

[h1]Special Features[/h1]
[h2]Transmutation[/h2]
An alchemist’s creations are called [i]transmutations[/i] and come in two broad types.
[h4]Permanent[/h4]
Permanent transmutations require ample preparation and execution time. The resulting item is durable and behaves like a regular piece of equipment. [h3]Volatile[/h3]
Fast, combat‑ready workings cast on the fly. Their effects fade quickly (usually after one Phase) and the product crumbles to dust afterward.

[h2]Focus Gloves[/h2]
Alchemists use [i]focus gloves[/i] inscribed with alchemical runes to safely channel volatile transmutations. The gloves’ [url:values#AV]Armor Value (AV)[/url] equals the value of their mundane counterpart (e.g., cloth, leather).

[h1]Alchemical Schools[/h1]
[h3]Mechanics[/h3]
The creation of devices and constructs: everything from firearms and ammunition to golems and specialized tools.
[h3]Pharmacy[/h3]
The brewing of poisons, remedies, and diverse chemical compounds.

[h2]Basic Elements[/h2]
The four basic elements [b]Water[/b], [b]Stone[/b], [b]Fire[/b], and [b]Air[/b] are the core of alchemy. Cores and dust of those elements are relatively easy to obtain by drawing them from ambient mana or slaying elementals.
[h2]Derivative Elements[/h2]
There are countless derivative elements, but only the following two are stable enough to use offensively:
[br][b]Ice[/b]: Water + Stone
[br][b]Lightning[/b]: Fire + Air
[h2]Aether[/h2]
Aether, known among wizards as "the Arcane", is understood by alchemists as the critical link between mass and elemental energy. Many devote themselves to its study, but few ever manage to grasp more than the very basics of its workings, since it seems to respond more to [i]intent[/i] than any measurable factors.
[br]Most alchemists grudgingly accept it as the unknowable foundation of their craft and simply rely on it behaving in accordance with their wishes and experience.
