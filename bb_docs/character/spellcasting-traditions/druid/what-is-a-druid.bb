[h1]Druids[/h1]
Druids use esoteric nature magic, passed down in druidic communities for millennia. The specifics vary from circle to circle, but they all share a reverence for nature and the circle of life.

[h1]Special Features[/h1]
[h2]Vegetation[/h2]
Druids—especially those focused on [i]Flora[/i]—need access to different plant types for their magic. With the right seeds, they can grow many of these plants themselves.
[h3]Restrictions[/h3]
[h4]Range[/h4]
A druid can only control plants within [[section:clr-attr]WIL[/section] + [section:clr-value]Flora[/section]] × [section:clr-value]2[/section] meters.
[h4]Lifespan[/h4]
Plants created via [i]Wildgrowth[/i] that are no longer sustained by Concentration wither at the end of the druid’s next turn; once concentration breaks, it can’t be re-established for that effect.
[h4]Magical Plants[/h4]
Druids cannot create magical plants with [i]Wildgrowth[/i].
[h3]Plant Types[/h3]
[b]Herb:[/b] Any non-woody plant (e.g., grasses, mosses, flowers, perennials).
[br][b]Shrub:[/b] Woody growth with several stem-like shoots and no single main trunk (e.g., bushes, hedges).
[br][b]Tree:[/b] A plant with a distinct woody main trunk; typically more massive than shrubs.

[h2]Staff Spells[/h2]
Some druid spells can be cast as [i]Staff Spells[/i]. This requires a wooden staff (or comparable item) as a “plant substitute.” Because a staff is dead wood, the druid must physically touch it while casting.

[h2]Soul Anchor[/h2]
To summon a wild animal or assume its form, a druid needs a Soul Anchor: a ritually prepared trophy from an honorable hunt (commonly horns, claws, or teeth) that houses the animal’s soul. If the animal form is slain, the anchor shatters and the soul returns irrevocably to the Eternal Wilderness. Keeping a soul trapped for too long is frowned upon; druids are strongly advised to release it no later than after one year.
[h3]Regeneration[/h3]
Animal souls regain one wound per full hour of inactivity while stored in the anchor.
[h3]Soul Bond[/h3]
A soul that undergoes the [i]Soul Bond[/i] ritual no longer needs an anchor; it links to the druid’s soul until either party dissolves the bond. If that form/summon is slain, it heals within the druid’s astral body and can be called again once regeneration is complete.

[h1]Foci[/h1]
Druid foci can be quite varied, though many use staffs made from gnarled branches of ancient trees (so-called 'Shillelaghs'). Most important for a Druid focus is that its base material was once – or still is – alive.

[h1]Proficiency Values[/h1]
[h3]Fauna[/h3]
Each point in [i]Fauna[/i] [url:core#Eased]eases[/url] Concentration checks for [i]Theriomorphosis[/i] by [section:clr-value]1[/section] and grants [section:clr-value]+1[/section] [url:def#WL]WL[/url] to summoned animal souls.
[h3]Flora[/h3]
Each point in [i]Flora[/i] increases [section:clr-dc]DC[/section], [section:clr-pa]PA[/section], and [section:clr-sa]SA[/section] of all [i]Flora[/i] spells by [section:clr-value]1[/section].

[h1]Expertise[/h1]
Druid spells with the keyword [section:clr-exper]Expertise[/section] can be cast at a higher tier once the Druid reaches the corresponding expertise rank:
[br][b]Expertise 1[/b] – [i]Beginner[/i]
[br][b]Expertise 2[/b] – [i]Intermediate[/i]
[br][b]Expertise 3[/b] – [i]Adept[/i]
