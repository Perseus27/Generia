[h1]Nox[/h1]
Followers of Nox, goddess of night and shadows, are few in number. All meetings are held masked and veiled so that as few members as possible know each other personally – necessary precautions, as Nox often operate far outside the law and Sol’s grace. The goddess, herself a shadowy and mysterious figure, grants shadow magic that is sometimes – wrongly – equated with demonic magic. The Order of the Eternal Light tolerates the Nox only in exchange for occasional… [i]services[/i].

[h1]Special Features[/h1]
[h2]Shadow Summoning[/h2]
Nox acolytes can give their own shadow physical form and control it like a familiar. Using the [i]Shadow Thief[/i] ritual, they can also steal the shadow of another creature and employ it the same way. The moment the creature notices its shadow is missing, the shadow returns to its owner and the Nox loses access – hence it is recommended (but not required) to steal the shadows of dead but not yet “soulless” creatures. A creature is considered soulless once more than 12 hours have passed since its death.
[h3]Details[/h3]
[h4]Storage[/h4]
For each point in [i]Shadow[/i], [i]Shadow Thief[/i] can “store” one creature. Your own shadow does not count and is always available.
[h4]Capabilities[/h4]
Summoned shadows use the stat block of their original owners, but their Wound Limit ([url:values#WL]WL[/url]) is always [section:clr-value]1[/section], and they have no resources of their own ([section:clr-en]EN[/section] and [section:clr-mp]MP[/section]). Their skills and spells spend the Nox’s own resources.

[h1]Foci[/h1]
Nox prefer subtle foci like unassuming rings, though some have been noted to use blessed daggers.

[h1]Proficiency Values[/h1]
[h3]Night[/h3]
Each point in [i]Night[/i] grants [section:clr-value]1[/section] Nox Point ([section:clr-np]NP[/section]), which can be spent instead of [section:clr-mp]MP[/section] on Nox spells. NP are refreshed at midnight.
[h3]Shadow[/h3]
Each point in [i]Shadow[/i] grants one Shadow Slot.
